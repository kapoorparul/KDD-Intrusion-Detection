# KDD-Intrusion-Detection
This assignment was part of the course CS631 on Cyber Security for critical infrastructure at IITK.
In this assignment, we are required to perform intrusion detection task on the
KDD99 dataset. The intrusion detector learning task is to build a classifier capable
of distinguishing between ”bad” connections, called intrusions or attacks, and
”good” normal connections. Attacks fall into four main categories:
1. DOS : denial-of-service
2. R2L: unauthorized access from a remote machine
3. U2R: unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges
4. Probing: surveillance and other probing

The dataset is at http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html

Results obtained:
Precison         0.999031
Recall           0.884460
F-score          0.921850
Accuracy         0.999998
